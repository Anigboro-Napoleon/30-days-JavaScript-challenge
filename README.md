# 30 days JavaScript challenge
JavaScript is a programming language that one can't fully know and it always looks like the more you write JS codes the more it seems confusing but the key to SOLVING this issue and being able to wrap your head around JavaScript even just a little bit is by practicing and building more projects.

Hence the reason why I jumped on this challenge and decided to take the challenge till the end and I believe after 30 days, I won't be who I was initially anymore atleast JavaScript-wise :)

P.S: This challenge is a free challenge by wesbos and you can also take this challenge by clicking on https://javascript30.com/.
