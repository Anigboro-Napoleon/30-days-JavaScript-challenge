    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    console.log(players, team3);

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12, name: 'Jack'});
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain = {...person};
    captain.age = 50;
    captain.name = 'Jack';
    console.log(person);
    console.log(captain);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
